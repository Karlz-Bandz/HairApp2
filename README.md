# HairApp 2.0

<h2>New version of [hairbybieszczii.pl](https://hairbybieszczii.pl) <span style="fownt-weight: 900">(back-end)</h2>

This is the better and more stable application than ver. 1.0.
This update is caused of found various bugs connected to 
database operations especially during the deleting of client's
descriptions.

<li>Since ver 2.0 application is compatible with PostgreSQL by default</li>
<li>New features like put request that can change the description</li>
<li>In all cases the database is always clean(Delete user, Delete description, Change description etc.)</li>
<li>Code cleaner</li><br>

When click the link you can see the public website. In this file I'd like to show screenshots
that shows how client management works. All data on the images is a fake data generated by 
[https://www.mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com/) fake database generator
