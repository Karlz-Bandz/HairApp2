# HairApp 2.0
New version of hairbybieszczii.pl (back-end)

This is the better and more stable application than ver. 1.0.
This update is caused of found various bugs connected to 
database operations especially during the deleting of client's
descriptions.

-Since ver 2.0 application is compatible with PostgreSQL by default
-New features like put request that can change the description
-In all cases the database is always clean(Delete user, Delete description, Change description etc.)
-Code cleaner

Work on HairApp 2.0 is still in progress
You need to wait for more documentation

SOON!
