# HairApp 2.0

New version of [hairbybieszczii.pl](https://hairbybieszczii.pl) (back-end)

This is the better and more stable application than ver. 1.0.
This update is caused of found various bugs connected to 
database operations especially during the deleting of client's
descriptions.

-Since ver 2.0 application is compatible with PostgreSQL by default
-New features like put request that can change the description
-In all cases the database is always clean(Delete user, Delete description, Change description etc.)
-Code cleaner

When click the link you can see the public website. In this file I'd like to show screenshots
that shows how client management works. All data on the images is a fake data generated by 
[https://www.mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com/) fake database generator
