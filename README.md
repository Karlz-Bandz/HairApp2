# HairApp 2.0

New version of [hairbybieszczii.pl](https://hairbybieszczii.pl) (back-end)

This is the better and more stable application than ver. 1.0.
This update is caused of found various bugs connected to 
database operations especially during the deleting of client's
descriptions.

<li>Since ver 2.0 application is compatible with PostgreSQL by default</li>
<li>New features like put request that can change the description</li>
<li>In all cases the database is always clean(Delete user, Delete description, Change description etc.)</li>
<li>Code cleaner</li><br>

When click the link you can see the public website. In this file I'd like to show screenshots
that shows how client management works. All data on the images is a fake data generated by 
[https://www.mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com/) fake database generator

<h2>1. Login</h2>

![login](https://github.com/Karlz-Bandz/HairApp2/assets/57764322/cef4feb3-0004-4fe7-a4e4-3c81a1d753c2)

When click the button on the left bottom corner it routs to the login page. All client's data API is 
secured and configured by Spring Security

<h2>2. Menu</h2>

![menu](https://github.com/Karlz-Bandz/HairApp2/assets/57764322/bee3d948-7f00-4778-bc24-0126293bf592)

After successful login you can see menu window and the first option is AddClient

<h2>3. Add Client</h2>

![addCLient](https://github.com/Karlz-Bandz/HairApp2/assets/57764322/059605fd-1511-4022-b04e-8679dd921fee)

On the picture is Add Client window and you have to provide name, last name and client's phone number. After 
submit API creates Http POST request and save data in PostgreSQL that is installed on the server.

<h2>4. Add Description</h2>

![addDescription](https://github.com/Karlz-Bandz/HairApp2/assets/57764322/67ae8dbf-216f-41c6-bc5e-a826caba3d0a)

In Add Description window you can chose one client from data and after that write some description to the client.
After submit API creates Http POST request and save descripton inside table 'descriptions' which is related 
whith choosen client. This request also generates the current date and saves it in description table.

<h2>5. Presentation</h2>

![chose](https://github.com/Karlz-Bandz/HairApp2/assets/57764322/72784a36-b79e-4f75-a33b-3c6d32e8b790)

![PresentationInterface](https://github.com/Karlz-Bandz/HairApp2/assets/57764322/4056dc4e-7e50-4c25-ba2b-8408d3a2896a)

In the Presentation now you can see more functions than in version 1. First you have to chose the client from select box
and submit. After that you can see all descriptions with dates added before and sor them from the oldest to the newest or
inversely. If you want you can also delete the chosen description and this method will never corrupt the database as it 
used to be before.

![ChangeDesc](https://github.com/Karlz-Bandz/HairApp2/assets/57764322/22da5497-0f7e-4628-8854-28eecb25be3e)

The new functionality is that you can modify descriptions in the real time. You need to just click on the text, change it and submit
and the text will be change and set the current date.

<h2>6. Delete</h2>

The last function is Delete Client. You have to choose the client fromt the select box and submit. This function delete the client
and the all data that is related to this client.
